Other (Specify in comments),2023-09-27 16:00:24,36.97867,-121.93563,1,179549,"Hello, 
On Wednesday 9/27 I (and many others on the beach) saw a whale swimming along New Brighton Beach on Monterey Bay in Santa Cruz county. I’m curious about ID on the whale because it looked completely unlike a humpback, also smaller but not a sea lion or other mammal - definitely a whale. It was surfacing to breathe and not doing a high arch like a humpback but more of just putting its nose up then back under for 45 seconds to a minute or longer. The nose/face was very crusted in barnacles to the point of being brownish. I didn’t see dorsal or pectoral fins. It was heading north along the beach and then turned north west and went out of view in the distance. In trying to find what type of whale this may have been, the only photos I can find of other whales that look similar are gray whales, but it seems as though this isn’t the correct time of year for them. I’m wondering  if someone at your organization could offer any insight as I’m super curious about what type of whale i saw. Thank you!"

There were at least 3 fluke breaches Roughly 1/3 of a mile out from shore. Another plume of mist signified another whale, slightly south of the calf and mother an hour into their resting. The calf and mother then moved north seemly and other plumes were seen to the south. I am thinking there are more than 3, but I wanted to be conservative because I know for sure there are three. 

The photo I included is of one of the plumes of the mother and calf where they were resting close to shore. "

Humpback,2021-12-28 21:15:00,41.47,-71.43,4,139353,"Was going for a boat ride with my dad on Tuesday afternoon/evening out of narrow river, Narragansett. We first saw something that looked like a whale south of us on the horizon, but couldn’t tell for sure. As they moved north toward us we saw at least one breach, and eventually saw multiple surfacing at the same time, one of which seemed very large. We could only confirm 3 but there may have been 4 or 5 of them. They were last seen about halfway between whale rock and beavertail point. We’re fairly confident they were humpbacks because of the dorsal fin and the knobby heads. Unfortunately, neither of us had our phones and we’re not able to take any photos"

We all saw the large spout of the whale first.  Then as the animals all came closer we saw it on the surface and dive shallowly numerous times.  We could see the bumps on the head, the dorsal fin, and once it turned and poked its white flipper out of the water.  Quite an amazing sight to see less than .5 mile from shore.  In all our many years of kayaking and canoeing no one of us had ever seen a humpback just offshore in Santa Barbara.  Hawaii, yes, but never here.  
 
For some reason the location is showing my house, but I can’t show the location where we saw the humpback."

Unspecified,2021-03-11 14:00:11,29.2761296039,-81.031745374,1,125103,I saw something large in the water very close to shore from my balcony on 6th floor. I watched it and it came up again but it did not act like a dolphin because of the way it emerged from the water and did not have a dorsal fin. It was too big and fast to be a manatee. I watched it swim out to sea diagonally and emerge from water two or three more times and that’s when the air blew out of the water and  I realized this might be a whale

Yesterday he was in with J38 Cookie and L105 Fluke, among others. J50 Scarlet was present also. (The August 1 update is J35 Tahlequah is still carrying her deceased daughter, for nine days now. It's difficult to imagine what she has been going through or the effort required to carry her baby hundreds of miles. We hope she finds the right time to let go, and that the body of her newborn returns peacefully to the sea. We are all struggling alongside her as we watch from afar, with a renewed fire to do whatever we can on behalf of the Southern Residents.) -Monika Wieland Shields, OBI"
