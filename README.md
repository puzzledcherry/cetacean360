This project interfaces with Acartio.io, a decentralized data cooperative, to ingest cetacean sighting data from the Puget Sound region and surrounding areas. The Python script processes and cleans the raw dataset, applying algorithms to identify and link sightings with a high probability of representing the same individual or pod of cetaceans. The data is then visualized using Plotly, mapping cetacean movement patterns over time.
