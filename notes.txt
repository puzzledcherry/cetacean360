--------
learning python
applications: software development (websites), data science (machine learning), 
automation (scripts)


---------
clean code & conventions
class names should follow CapsWords rather then underscore (MyDog)
function names should be all lowercase and utilize underscores (calc_force)
variable names follow function names 

indentation is important, groups lines of code together
4 spaces per indentation

# comments marked with hashtag, block and in-line both utilize hashtag


---------
running python code
no compile step, literally just write it using "python myscript.py"


---------
program structure

def main():                     # defines the start of the program
    print('Hello World!')
 
if __name__ == '__main__':      # check if the program is running independently or or a library
    main()                      # this seems to be at the end of like every program


---------
input & output

literally just input() method call
ex. name = input('what is your name?')

ouput using print()
-> may concatenate variables to a string using commas, and string to strings using + or comma
ex. print('You are ', age, ' years old')
ex. print('Very nice to meet you, ' + name + '!')

formatting string literals when printing
example belows makes all uppercase
ex. print(f'Very nice to meet you, {name.upper()}!')

str.format() is a more manua way of string manipluation 
define a placholder with {} then using .format to format the data that goes into the placeholder

examples
txt1 = "My name is {fname}, I'm {age}".format(fname = "John", age = 36)
txt2 = "My name is {0}, I'm {1}".format("John",36)
txt3 = "My name is {}, I'm {}".format("John",36)

txt = "For only {price:.2f} dollars!"
print(txt.format(price = 49))


---------
if, elif, else 

if score >= 80:
   print('You pass the course with flying colors!')
 
elif score > 65:
   print('You pass the course! Talk to your instructor.')
  
else:
   print('You do not pass the course!')


---------
for loops, while loops

nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
for num in nums:        # each element is referred to as 'num'
  print(num + 1)

for i in range(3):      # iterates between 0 - 2
  print(i)

i = 1
while i < 6:
  print(i)
  i += 1
