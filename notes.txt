Plotly and Dash are related but serve different purposes. 
Plotly is a data visualization library, while Dash is a web application framework 
for building interactive web-based analytical applications.

Plotly provides a set of tools for creating various types of interactive plots and charts. 
It supports multiple programming languages, including Python, R, and JavaScript. 
Users can use Plotly to generate visually appealing and interactive visualizations.

Dash, on the other hand, is built on top of Plotly and allows users to create web 
applications with interactive dashboards. Dash enables the creation of web-based 
data visualizations, interactive dashboards, and analytical applications using Python. 
It integrates seamlessly with Plotly for creating the visual components of the dashboard.

In summary, while Plotly is primarily a data visualization library, Dash extends 
its capabilities by providing a framework to build interactive web applications 
using Plotly charts and other interactive components. Users often use both Plotly 
and Dash together to create powerful and interactive data-driven web applications.
